#
# Collect and package libraries used by Application 
# and other libraries needed to read a corefile 
# on a system other than the one that generated it.
#
# Latest Copy should always be located at: 
# /net/bur-home1.east/global/export/home1/43/ra138236/bin/pkgcore.sh
#
# Usage:
#
#   pkgcore {case# or package file} {corefile} [processid|Executable]
#   Note: processid & Executabe will only be used on Solaris 7 and 
#         earlier versions of Solaris, it will be ignored on Solaris 8	
#         and later versions 
#
# Output:
#
#	casenumber_libraries.tar.gz
#	casenumber_corefile.tar.gz
#
# Limitations
#
# Some of the referenced libraries can be accessed via more than one link/path
# the path/link used but this script may differ from the one that gdb will want
# to use locally, especially if the libraries are found using an executable versus
# the corefile or PID, adding the additional links when unpacking the data may be required
#
# When checking for previous output files it only checks for gzipped versions
#
# Note when Editing
#
# Please place more static and system wide information into the ${UNIQUEBASE}/extras directory
# and more dynamic and corefile related information into the ${UNIQUEBASE}/info directory
# this will allow multiple core files to be processed and only the  casenumber_corefile.tar.*
# file to be sent to Versant as the libraries and executeable are not likely to change between 
# two crashes, etc..
#
# Variables used within the script
#
# $LINUXVERSION integer which is the Linux kernel version (or the number after the second  decimal point in uname -r )
# $CASENUMBER used to uniquely package the data and hopefully to keep all the corefile data straight
# $COREFILE absolute path to the corefile being processed
# $EXEFILE absolute path to the executable file 
# $THIRDARG determination if $3 is a PID or Executable ( will be "PID" or "EXE" respectively )
#

#
#
# Change Log
#
# 2005-May-12: initial creation
# 2005-May-16: Finished up work to allow use on Solaris 7 and possibly earlier versions of Solaris
# 2005-May-17: created and saved a simple opencore script to be included in core archive
# 2005-May-26: Fixed bug where script would crash if Case# contained '/' which is not valid within a filename
# 2005-Jul-07: Discovered case where UNIQUEBASE contained a space which broke script
# 2005-Jul-08: Fixed issue, date was space padding output, removed spaces
# 2005-Nov-05: added logic to allow it to function on Solaris X86.  This is not simple because where as on
#		sparc the pmap lists the executable as being the first file mapped into the address space, this
#		is not the case on x86, I am guessing that the executable is always mapped in between the stack
#		and heap and it is the ONLY file mapped into this space, if this  is not true the script will fail
# 2005-Nov-06: Also found a problem if the executable does not exist in the same location it did when the corefile
#		was created and it's not in PATH ... mostly fixed...see limitations
# 2006-Apr-29: Previous to Solaris 10, /lib and /usr/lib were symbolicly linked together, this changed in Solaris 10.
#		Since they are different in Solaris 10 and could possibly be different the script should be altered to 
#		grab any _db libraries from the /lib as well as /usr/lib directory. Fixed by also grabbing debugging
#		libraries from the /lib directory.
# 2008-Aug-28: (Joe Sottile) Converted for RHEL4 from Solaris version so I can debug customer RHEL coredumps!!!!!
# 2013.04.11: (Joe Sottile) Converted for RHEL5 to get full library list and ignore vdso pseudo-library
# 2013.04.24: (Joe Sottile) Changed .gdbinit and opencore to fix chicken-before-egg problem. Now everything loads
#                           properly.
# 2013.04.29: (Joe Sottile) Changed .gdbinit to set a search path for libthread_db.so.1 and modified gdb parser
#                           to work with GDB 7.6 as well as GDB 7.0. Added code for gdb 7.0 to use found libpthread
#                           and get the libthread_db from that directory. Allow PATH to override location of gdb.
#                           Make a concerted effort to enable POSIX thread debugging. Compress while tarring for
#							corefiles. Added update date and script output header message identifying UPDATEDATE
# 2014.08.28: (Joe Sottile) Added copy of this script to the extras directory.
# 2015.06.02: (Joe Sottile) For server (cleanbe/obe) crashes, get LOGFILE and systrace dump into extras 
# 2015.06.03: (Joe Sottile) Also copy saved systrace and vbb binary files to extras for database crashes
